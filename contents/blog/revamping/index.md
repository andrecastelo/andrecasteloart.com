I started writing this entry in a really bad mood, and it started sounding more and more like a departure or a goodbye - to the field, to art, to illustration. I think this is the closest I've been to quitting altogether and I haven't produced a single sketch in more than 5 months.

I feel that with social media it gets harder and harder to draw and paint something that I'm passionate about, something that I want expressed in the world, and not think about the likes it will get on Instagram or Facebook.

I quit my previous art mentorship because I had absolutely no passion or discipline - assignments took ages to finish and weeks would crawl by without any meaningful progress, all the while blaming my lack of art on my lack of time for art, and then distributing the blame to all sorts of things. Job. Girlfriend. Even a puppy.

In 2015 I decided to work on my mindset by hiring a coach for creatives, but that didn't work. I now have a perfectly good plan, with dates to send publishers my portfolio, dates to finish pieces and start new projects, dates that have already passed.

For 2016 I've decided to go simple and stop tryharding so much. I have no idea how to rekindle the passion for drawing, but as I've seen before forcing myself to draw would not work. So I will go slowly and see where it takes me.

Happy new year's everyone.

_ps.: by the way, I've quit Wordpress altogether and went with a simple **Wintersmith** static site generation, if any of you guys want to see the code, check it out @ [Github](https://github.com/andrecastelo/andrecasteloart.com)_
